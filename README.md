# Lightning Rods
A small mod which adds a single block: Lightning Rods!

Lightning rods use lightning to generate RF.
To use a lightning rod, just place it in the world and wait for a thunderstorm.

 

This mod is not a standalone - you need a mod that can use the RF this mod makes.

I recommend also using JEI because the recipe changes depending on which mods you are using.
